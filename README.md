# Predictive Analysis of Housing Prices Using Ames Housing Dataset

## Introduction
Accurately predicting housing prices is crucial for real estate investment decisions. Using the Ames Housing dataset, we conduct both descriptive and predictive analyses to assist investors in evaluating property values. Our goal is to predict the sale price, considering various influential factors.

## Descriptive Analysis
We explore the dataset's structure, distribution, and key features impacting housing prices through correlation analysis and visualizations.

## Predictive Analysis
Using machine learning models, we aim to predict housing prices and establish robust models. The following models are employed:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Support Vector Regression

## Model Evaluation
Performance evaluation includes metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

We ensure reliability through cross-validation techniques.

## Results and Interpretation
We analyze model performance, providing insights for investors to make informed property valuation and investment decisions.

## Conclusion
Descriptive and predictive analyses using the Ames Housing dataset assist investors in evaluating property values accurately, aiding in maximizing investment returns.
